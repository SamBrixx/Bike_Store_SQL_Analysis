# Bike Store Data Analysis with SQL
## Project Overview

This project showcases my ability to analyze a relational database to answer real-world business questions. Using the Bike Store Relational Database, I performed a series of data manipulations and queries to extract key insights related to sales, customer behavior, and inventory management. This project demonstrates practical skills in SQL, data aggregation, and business intelligence.

## Data Source

The dataset for this project is a sample relational database for a fictional bike store chain. It includes tables for customers, products, orders, stores, and staffs, providing a comprehensive view of the business operations.

## Key Questions & Objectives

The primary goal of this analysis was to answer a series of business-critical questions to inform decision-making. The queries were designed to explore the following areas:

1. Sales Performance: How much revenue did each store generate, and which store was the top performer?

2. Product & Category Insights: Which products and categories are the most popular, and how do they contribute to overall sales?

3. Customer Behavior: Who are the most valuable customers in terms of total spending?

4. Staff & Store Efficiency: How do staff performance and inventory levels vary across different store locations?

## Skills Demonstrated

This project highlights proficiency in the following SQL concepts:

- Data Retrieval: Using SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses to filter and retrieve specific information.

- Joins: Combining data from multiple tables using INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN to connect customers, orders, products, and stores.

- Aggregation: Utilizing SUM(), COUNT(), and AVG() with GROUP BY to perform complex calculations and summarize data.

- Subqueries & CTEs: Using advanced techniques like subqueries and Common Table Expressions to solve multi-step problems and improve query readability.

- Data Ordering: Sorting results using ORDER BY to present data in a logical and easy-to-interpret manner.

## Key Findings

After performing the analysis, I was able to uncover several valuable insights:
- The top-performing store was [Store Name], which generated [X]% of the total company revenue in the analyzed period.

- [Product Category] was the most popular product category, accounting for [Y]% of all sales.

- The top customer was [Customer Name], who spent [$$ amount] and placed [#] orders.
